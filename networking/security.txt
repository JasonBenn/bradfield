8 - Security

Security was not a first class concern of the pioneers of computer networking, and so is not at the core of its most important protocols, so much as retrofitted around them. It is however a critically important consideration in using computer networks, so this class covers the means to which we go to secure internet communication at every layer, including SSL/TLS, PGP, IPSec and WPA.
