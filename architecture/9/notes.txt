weak scaling - sometimes called horizontal scaling
- you have to increase the problem size to get perf benefits
- improves throughput but not latency

strong scaling - improves latency, not throughput
- it's like pipelining is weak scaling, improving clock speed = strong scaling

programmer delivers unfinished final image
then kernels transform image and copy result to frame buffer, which is what computer renders to screen

memory-mapped IO - some region of memory that host writes to, that GPU always copies over to its memory. for example kernels/shader instructions.

bus: just means set of wires between memory

GPU has no controls, it just continually running the programs and data that you send it. so CPU has to sneak it back out.

CPU has a crappy internal GPU!
Now GPUs have some crappy internal CPUs! GPUs want fetch-execute cycle.
Hard part is making use of all the circuitry.
