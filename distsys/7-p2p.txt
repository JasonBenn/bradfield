Simplest DHT
"Replication is an application-level concern"
  Maybe concat "1" to a user ID, hash, and add again

Node IP addresses are hashed and that's where they live along the ring of key space!
Then keys are hashed and placed on the ring of key space, to be stored at the next successor.

Innovation is log n skips, instead of going thru neighbors, and every node maintains finger table of 2^i nodes.
